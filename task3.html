<p><b>Among Us</b> is an online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American[4] game studio InnerSloth and released on June 15, 
2018. The game takes place in a space-themed setting, in which players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being 
Impostors.The goal of the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the Impostors' goal is to covertly 
sabotage and kill the Crewmates before they complete all of their tasks. Players suspected to be Impostors may be eliminated via a plurality vote, which
 any player may initiate at any time. Crewmates win if all Impostors are eliminated or all tasks are completed; Imposters win if there is an equal number of 
 Impostors and Crewmates, or if a critical sabotage goes unresolved.</p>

 <h2>How to play</h2>
Among Us is a multiplayer game for four to ten players.
 One to three players (depending on what the host selected) are chosen to be the impostor(s) each round. A game can take place on one of three maps: 
 a spaceship called "The Skeld", a headquarters building called "Mira HQ", or a planet base called "Polus"In each game's lobby, various options can be 
 adjusted to customize aspects of gameplay, such as the vision range of the Crewmates and the Impostors, and the allowed number of emergency meetings..</p>

At the start of the game, Crewmates are given "tasks" to complete around the map in the 
form of minigames, consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as electrical rewiring and engine refueling. Impostors are given a fake list of 
tasks to blend in with Crewmates, although they are unable to actually complete any task. Impostors can sabotage vital systems, covertly travel through air
 vents, and work with other Impostors to kill Crewmates. If a player dies, they become a ghost. Ghosts can pass through walls, are invisible to everyone 
 except other ghosts, and are limited in their capacity to interact with the world; however, they must still complete their tasks.[17][18] All players except
 ghosts[19] have a limited cone of vision, only allowing them to see other players within a certain unblocked distance around them.</p>

<h2>How to  win the game</h2>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnpjpdhUNjY">Watch online tutorial!</a>The Crewmates win by completing all tasks, or by identifying and eliminating
 all Impostors. The Impostors win when the number of Impostors is equal to the number of Crewmates, or when a sabotage countdown reaches zero. Ghosts help 
 their living teammates by completing tasks (as a Crewmate) or performing sabotages (as an Impostor). When an Impostor performs a sabotage, either there is 
 an immediate consequence (such as all the lights being turned off) or a countdown begins. In the latter case, if the sabotage is not resolved before the 
 countdown finishes, the Impostors win. Sabotages can be resolved by living players in varying ways depending on which sabotage is performed.[16][17][18] 
 Games can also end by players quitting the match if doing so fulfills any win condition; a player quitting is equivalent to them being eliminated, and a 
 Crewmate quitting leads to their tasks being considered completed for the total</p>

To help the Crewmates identify Impostors, there are various surveilance systems in each map, such as a security camera system on The Skeld,[23] a doorlog 
in Mira HQ,[24] and a vitals indicator in Polus.[16] Any living player may call a group meeting by reporting a dead body, or by pressing a button in the map
 at any time (except when a sabotage is in progress).[18][25][26] This halts all other gameplay. In the meeting, players discuss who they believe is an 
 Impostor based on the available evidence.[17][18] A plurality vote is held, and the chosen player is ejected from the map and dies.[17][18] Players can 
 communicate in a text chat,[17] but only during meetings, and only if they are alive (though ghosts can speak with one another at any time).
 While the game does not have a built-in voice chat system, it is common for players to use external programs such as Discord while playing</p>
